# About This Directory
This directory is designed to hold the configuration files for your instance of NEMO. 

# Readable configuration files
1) Name your file login_file.txt
2) The file needs to have the following information, on separate lines, in the order given: <br/>
  PORT - port number for the database server, for MySQL, this is typically 3306 <br/>
  MySQL USER NAME - user name to access the database <br/>
  PASSWORD - password to access the database <br/>
  DATABASE - name of the database to access <br/>
  
# To-Do
Several updates to the nature of config files are planned/under consideration. As updates are completed, this README will be updated accordingly.
1) The config file will also need to include the local path to the data and data schema files in the data directory
2) Using JSON technology instead of flat text files.
