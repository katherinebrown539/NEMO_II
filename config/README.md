  PORT - port number for the database server, for MySQL, this is typically 3306 <br/>
  MySQL USER NAME - user name to access the database <br/>
  PASSWORD - password to access the database <br/>

  DATA - name of the data file (see the data readme for more details) <br/>
  SCHEMA - name of the schema file (see the data readme for more details) <br/>

# Recent Updates
1) The config file will also need to include the local path to the data and data schema files in the data directory <br/>
2) Using JSON technology instead of flat text files. <br/>
