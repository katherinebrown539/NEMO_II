The Never-Ending Medical Operative (NEMO) is a system under development to implement Lifelong Machine Learning in the healthcare domain. <br/>

# Version History: <br/>
Version 1.0 (Current) - Currently performs Automated Machine Learning to optimize a Artificial Neural Network.

Pull the dev branch for the development version of NEMO. Use at your own risk! 

# How to Run <br/>
1) Visit the README.md files in the data and config directories and follow the appropriate instructructions.
2) Once the data files and configuration files are set up, pull from GitHub to ensure you have the most recent version.
3) Run: python NEMO.py

To quit: Press Ctrl+C or equivalent. Currently, it takes  few tries to shut off the system.

# TO-DO
